# Hi, I'm Mike 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

I'm a student and a frontend developer creating websites in many technologies and frameworks. I also want to get closer to the metal 🔨 so I create software in C++, C#, Rust 🦀 and Python. Electron is terrifying me ⚛.

I'm currently working on some new fascinating projects, so be sure to follow me to not miss out on new stuff I'll be releasing soon.

I built a Web App using Angular Material framework, a simple Server Manager program for Windows and much more! I'm also a co-author of a Discord multipurpose bot written in JavaScript.

I'm having a lot of fun with the latest technologies, mainly Cryptocurrencies 💰 and Artificial Inteligence 👁️.
