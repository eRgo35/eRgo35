# Hi, I'm Mike 👋🏻 👨🏻‍💻

<p>I'm a student and a frontend developer creating websites in many technologies and frameworks. I also want to get closer to the metal 🔨 so I create software in C++, C# and Python. Electron is terrifying me :electron:.</p>
<p>I built a <a href="https://github.com/eRgo35/Project-TSI">Web App</a> using Angular Material framework, a simple <a href="https://github.com/eRgo35/Server-Manager">Server Manager</a> program for Windows and much more! I'm also a co-author of a Discord <a href="https://github.com/HiveMindStudios/MelvinJS">multipurpose bot</a> written in JavaScript.</p> 
<p>I'm having a lot of fun with the latest technologies, mainly Cryptocurrencies 💰 and Artificial Inteligence 👁️.</p>
